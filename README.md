# Node API without Express

## TODO list

- [x] GET /singers: Show the list of singers from `singers.json`
- [x] GET /singers?country=Ghana -> Implement country filter
- [x] GET /singers?name=P-Square -> Implement name filter (assigned to @Anita)
- [x] GET /singers?name=P-Square -> Implement songName filter (assigned to @Anita)
- [x] Add more content to the `singers.json` file (assigned to @Anita)
- [ ] PUT endpoint and modify locally the `singers.json` file (C in CRUD) (assigned to @Anita)

## To go further

- [ ] Transform it to Express API
- [ ] Do the rest of CRUD (CUD)
- [ ] MongoDB instead of local JSON
