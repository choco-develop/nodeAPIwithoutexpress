# Node API without Express

## TODO list

- [x] GET /singers: Show the list of singers from `singers.json`
- [ ] GET /singers?country=Ghana -> Show the list of singers from Ghana
- [ ] GET /singers?name=P-Square -> Show the list of singers from Ghana (assigned to @Annita)

## To go further

- [ ] Transform it to Express API
- [ ] Do the rest of CRUD (CUD)
- [ ] MongoDB instead of local JSON
